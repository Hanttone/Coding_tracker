# Coding_tracker
My take on tracking things, in this case I am tracking the amount of time I spend coding and analysing it.

The app has a start and end button + a refresh button for the graph to refresh. Still need to fix the refresh button to work in the correct way. 
Currently the refresh button only generates a new graph underneath the exisiting one.
